In this project we will be focusing on implementing the colour space conversion algorithm on an ARM based system. Colour space conversion is necessary for reducing the storage requirements and/or transmission rate. The algorithm we will be implementing will be RGB to YCC colour space with a data storage of 8-bit integers. By using 8 bits to represent the color depth of red green and blue we are using a total of 24-bits to represent the colour depth of each pixel. This representation is known as true color, and means that the colors of an object in an image appear to a human observer the same way as if this observer were to directly view the object. 

To run the program simply run "python run.py" it will compile the programs for you and execute then each on a set of images testing each one
