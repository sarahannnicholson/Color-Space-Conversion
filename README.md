
#SENG 440 Colour space conversion project

In this project we will be focusing on implementing the colour space conversion algorithm on an ARM based system. Colour space conversion is necessary for reducing the storage requirements and/or transmission rate. The algorithm we will be implementing will be RGB to YCC colour space with a data storage of 8-bit integers.
